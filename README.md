# CS300
### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main goal was to make a C++ program that reads a file of course info, stores it, and lets the user either see all courses in order or look up details on one course, including prerequisites. Project One was focused on comparing run-time and memory use for different data structures to determine the best approach for coding, and Project Two put that into practice with a working program.

### How did you approach the problem?
I picked data structures that made sense for the task, an unordered_map for quick lookups by course number, an unordered_set for checking prerequisites, and a temporary vector to sort and print the list. Using hash table based structures helped keep lookups fast and the program organized.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks?
I didn't have any major roadblocks per se. One item I kept in mind so it didn't turn into an issue was making sure the program could handle bad or missing files without breaking. I added error messages, input checks, and some flexibility with file names to fix that. 

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I already try to stay organized when coding, and this project helped further strengthen that approach. I had to plan out the data structures, think through the flow, and test as I went.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Iâ€™ve gotten better at writing clear variable names, adding comments where needed and keeping code modular.
